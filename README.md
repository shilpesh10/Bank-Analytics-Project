# Bank-Analytics-Project
This project involves analyzing bank loan data to derive meaningful insights and create visualizations for better decision-making. The analysis focuses on various key performance indicators (KPIs) using MySQL, and Power BI.
# Problem Statement:
This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of a bank's loan portfolio, helping stakeholders understand loan distribution, repayment behavior, and overall portfolio health. The analysis identifies key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total loan applications, funded amounts, total loan amount, and loan performance metrics. By using this dashboard, stakeholders can make data-driven decisions to optimize loan processes and reduce risks.
# Tools and Technologies:
MySQL: Used for extraction, transformation, and analyzing data.

Power BI: Utilized for creating interactive dashboards and visualizing the data insights.

# Key Take Aways:
1) Loan Applications
•	The total number of loan applications is 39.7K.

•	Nearly half (48%) of these applications are verified, while the remaining 52% are unverified.

•	Consider optimizing the verification process to reduce unverified applications and improve efficiency.

2) Average Interest Rate
•	New customers receive loans at an average interest rate of 12.02%.

•	Repeat customers have a slightly higher average interest rate of 13.32%.

3) Homeownership Insights
•	Most homeowners are maintaining timely payments (“current” status).

•	A smaller portion falls into the “non-payment” category.
4) Risk Management
•	Monitor the payment status closely. The high percentage of “current” payments is positive, but keep an eye on the 17.1% in the “non-payment” category.
# Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the use of MySQL for data analysis, and Power BI for visualization. The KPIs provide valuable insights into loan performance, borrower characteristics, and other critical factors that can aid in decision-making processes.
